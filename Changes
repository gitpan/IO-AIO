Revision history for IO::AIO

0.5  Tue Jul 12 13:03:09 CEST 2005
	- removed #include <endian.h>, it's not portable, and we don't
          need it anyway.
        - link against -lrt, as it might contain goodies such as fdatasync,
          and often aio_read, which we do not use yet, but it shouldn't hurt.

0.4  Mon Jul 11 05:28:25 CEST 2005
	- added IO::AIO::flush, IO::AIO::poll.
        - make callback argument optional for all calls.

0.3  Mon Jul 11 01:42:37 CEST 2005
	- restructured manpage.
        - added SYNOPSIS with examples for Event, Glib, Tk.
        - remove explicit context support so I don't have to maintain
          it for threaded perls (i.e. it should work now :).

0.2  Sun Jul 10 22:57:12 CEST 2005
	- return immediately from poll_wait if nreqs==0.
        - get rid of the request pipe and use faster thread-thread
          communications for most requests and responses.

0.1
	- cloned from Linux::AIO, which is very similar.
