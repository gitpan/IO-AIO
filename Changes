Revision history for IO::AIO

1.1  Sun Aug  7 05:27:23 CEST 2005
	- added configure script to detect availability of some calls.
          (imperfect, as we cannot detect things like -lrt due to missing
          feedback yet).
        - emulate fdatasync via fsync, pread/pwrite via unsafe read/write
          and readahead via manual reading on platforms lacking those.
	- ported t/03_errors.t+framework by Brad Fitzpatrick
          from Linux::AIO.
	- removed XOPEN_SOURCE because stupid solaris 9 doesn't
          compile with it enabled. Probably breaks others. Oh well.
        - try to be more careful with errno on non-threaded perls.
        - cygwins perl insisted on a matching open mode when morphing
          the fd to an fh.
        - convert sv's to "byte" encoding in aio_read/aio_write. Might
          do that for pathnames, too, in the future, so make sure you
          properly encode your pathnames.

1.0  Fri Jul 22 10:43:30 CEST 2005
        - aio_open did not reliably deliver (open) filehandles.
        - all aio_*-functions keep a reference to the filehandle so
          it doesn't go away while the aio requests is working on it.
	- disable warnings in AIO.pm.

0.9  Wed Jul 20 23:55:04 CEST 2005
        - allow recursive calls to poll_cb, use less locking calls, too.
        - fix the Gtk2-example in the SYNOPSIS.
	- use pread/pwrite not pread64/pwrite64. this was simply a leftover
          from Linux::AIO.
          (found by compiling on cygwin. Unfortunately, cygwin declares but
          does not implement pread/pwrite).
	- only include <sys/syscall.h> on linux.

0.5  Tue Jul 12 13:03:09 CEST 2005
	- removed #include <endian.h>, it's not portable, and we don't
          need it anyway.
        - link against -lrt, as it might contain goodies such as fdatasync,
          and often aio_read, which we do not use yet, but it shouldn't hurt.

0.4  Mon Jul 11 05:28:25 CEST 2005
	- added IO::AIO::flush, IO::AIO::poll.
        - make callback argument optional for all calls.

0.3  Mon Jul 11 01:42:37 CEST 2005
	- restructured manpage.
        - added SYNOPSIS with examples for Event, Glib, Tk.
        - remove explicit context support so I don't have to maintain
          it for threaded perls (i.e. it should work now :).

0.2  Sun Jul 10 22:57:12 CEST 2005
	- return immediately from poll_wait if nreqs==0.
        - get rid of the request pipe and use faster thread-thread
          communications for most requests and responses.

0.1
	- cloned from Linux::AIO, which is very similar.
