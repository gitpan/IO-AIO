Revision history for IO::AIO

TODO: better autoconf.pm that can return LIBS etc.

2.0  Thu Oct 26 18:27:58 CEST 2006
	- minor incompatibility: max_outstanding semantics have changed.
	- major rewrite, consider all functionality EXPERIMENTAL.
        - aio requests can be cancelled.
        - callbacks can be (re-)set later.
        - aio requests can have choose 9 priorities.
        - add aio_group: aio requests can be grouped
          into composite requests.
        - generator interface for groups.
        - add IO::AIO::poll_some.
        - major documentation improvements.
        - very minor bugfixes.
        - add aio_nop for dummy requests.
        - add aio_busy mainly for benchmarking and debugging.
        - use "fast" mutexes on linux.
        - use dynamic (and larger) buffers instead of
          putting them onto the stack.
        - optimise x86 and amd64 a bit.
        - better error checking when ENOMEM.
        - hopefully fix mem and dirp leaks on fork.
        - warn about broken perl malloc.
        - compiles on cygwin (but pread is broken on cygwin
          which is not detected by autoconf, so you have to
          edit autoconf/config.h yourself to enable emulation).

1.8  Sat Jun 24 22:20:44 CEST 2006
	- add and/or document aio_rename, aio_link, aio_symlink and aio_move.

1.73 Wed Mar  1 22:49:32 CET 2006
	- codename "jost"
        - AIX/Solaris(?) aren't being helpful again, hardcode a value
          for NAME_MAX and drive with your eyes closed (reported by
          wcooley@nakedape.cc).

1.72 Thu Feb  2 00:40:44 CET 2006
	- another minor bug in aio_scandir, again, the callback was called
          twice when the directory can't be stat'ed.

1.71 Mon Dec 26 20:20:03 CET 2005
	- grr, another minor bug in aio_scandir, this time resulting
          in a runtime error.

1.7  Mon Dec 26 19:29:48 CET 2005
        - aio_scandir errornously called callback twice in some cases.
	- added AnyEvent example.

1.61 Wed Sep  7 19:40:42 CEST 2005
	- no longer include $Config{libs}, as distros include too much
          garbage in there that is not installed on typical systems
          (for example, debian links perl against -lgdbm and many more
          libraries despite perl not needing it, slowing down startup and
          wasting memory).

1.6  Tue Aug 30 17:44:44 CEST 2005
        - added aio_readdir, aio_scandir.
        - added aio_sendfile, including sendfile emulation when sendfile
          isn't available. Linux, FreeBSD and HP-UX might work (sendfilev
          support is unavailable on my solaris 8 machine, but preliminary
          code is there. What's lacking is configury stuff and testing...).

1.5  Sat Aug 20 02:32:19 CEST 2005
	- create the aio threads on demand only (good after forking).
	- somebody nagged about C89 compatibility, so this release should
          be C89 compatible, but no guarantees for future ones.
        - abort when the configure script fails.

1.4  Wed Aug 17 08:07:27 CEST 2005
	- forget to recreate the pipe after forking, this could cause
          deadlocks.

1.3  Wed Aug 17 07:25:54 CEST 2005
	- properly propagate exceptions from callbacks, instead of silently
          eating them.
        - use a different fork algorithm that avoids recursive callback
          invocations and reduces fork latency in busy processes.
        - fix a bug where the buffer scalar in aio_read got assigned the wrong
          length after reading.
        - fix a bug where the child would process some outstanding requests
          from the parent.
        - make a copy of the callback scalar, to avoid some very uncommon
          (but valid) usages where the callback scalar changes.
        - the callback was never freed in aio_read/aio_write.
        - aio_read/aio_write will now set the readonly flag on the data
          scalar for better error reporting.

1.2  Wed Aug 17 01:22:58 CEST 2005
	- verified on cygwin, linux/amd64+ia32+alpha, solaris.
        - use SvPVbyte for filenames now. You *need* to encode your strings to
          the external filename encoding first.
	- fix the bug where filehandles could leak (again).
        - clarify freebsd situation: make it work and tell me how, or go away
          with your underdocumented, broken and outdated OS.
        - fork'ing should now be officially supported (where linux and
          posix contradict each other, I followed posix).
        - only call read() once per poll, not twice (speedup).
        - new functions: aio_rmdir, aio_symlink.
        - force callback arguments to be undef or a reference, for better
          error catching.

1.1  Sun Aug  7 05:27:23 CEST 2005
	- added configure script to detect availability of some calls.
          (imperfect, as we cannot detect things like -lrt due to missing
          feedback yet).
        - emulate fdatasync via fsync, pread/pwrite via unsafe read/write
          and readahead via manual reading on platforms lacking those.
	- ported t/03_errors.t+framework by Brad Fitzpatrick
          from Linux::AIO.
	- removed XOPEN_SOURCE because stupid solaris 9 doesn't
          compile with it enabled. Probably breaks others. Oh well.
        - try to be more careful with errno on non-threaded perls.
        - cygwins perl insisted on a matching open mode when morphing
          the fd to an fh.
        - convert sv's to "byte" encoding in aio_read/aio_write. Might
          do that for pathnames, too, in the future, so make sure you
          properly encode your pathnames.

1.0  Fri Jul 22 10:43:30 CEST 2005
        - aio_open did not reliably deliver (open) filehandles.
        - all aio_*-functions keep a reference to the filehandle so
          it doesn't go away while the aio requests is working on it.
	- disable warnings in AIO.pm.

0.9  Wed Jul 20 23:55:04 CEST 2005
        - allow recursive calls to poll_cb, use less locking calls, too.
        - fix the Gtk2-example in the SYNOPSIS.
	- use pread/pwrite not pread64/pwrite64. this was simply a leftover
          from Linux::AIO.
          (found by compiling on cygwin. Unfortunately, cygwin declares but
          does not implement pread/pwrite).
	- only include <sys/syscall.h> on linux.

0.5  Tue Jul 12 13:03:09 CEST 2005
	- removed #include <endian.h>, it's not portable, and we don't
          need it anyway.
        - link against -lrt, as it might contain goodies such as fdatasync,
          and often aio_read, which we do not use yet, but it shouldn't hurt.

0.4  Mon Jul 11 05:28:25 CEST 2005
	- added IO::AIO::flush, IO::AIO::poll.
        - make callback argument optional for all calls.

0.3  Mon Jul 11 01:42:37 CEST 2005
	- restructured manpage.
        - added SYNOPSIS with examples for Event, Glib, Tk.
        - remove explicit context support so I don't have to maintain
          it for threaded perls (i.e. it should work now :).

0.2  Sun Jul 10 22:57:12 CEST 2005
	- return immediately from poll_wait if nreqs==0.
        - get rid of the request pipe and use faster thread-thread
          communications for most requests and responses.

0.1
	- cloned from Linux::AIO, which is very similar.
